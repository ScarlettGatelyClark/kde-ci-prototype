Docker Images
All system dependencies ( Anything that is NOT KDE or built with QT. )
Add to the respective docker/dist-version/Dockerfile

On docker host:
Create jenkins user with /home/jenkins
mkdir /srv/jenkins owner/group jenkins
create ssh keys and add to charlottes (master) jenkins authorized_keys and vise versa
create another key named jenkins_install and this  one must not have a passphrase Very important!1 it is for rsync and
only has access to artifact directory. Add the pub key to jinstaller user authorized keys on master.

In Jenkins:
Must be an administrator!!
Add jenkins user with ssh credentials ( use master ~.ssh should be fine unless you created non default names.
add your slave jenkins users ( be sure to add 
Add new cloud
Add your slave hosts ( in our case, we use swarm so only one host per image )
sgclarkkde/kde-slave-{distro}

{Ipoftheslavehost}:2375

TODO:
Get Ben to fill in swarm instructions

Add a new job to Jenkins ( if one does not already exist )
current naming scheme is create_distro_version_host
Add the git repo that hosts the dockerfiles
checkout to subdir jenkins home scripts/
restrict job to only build on master
Add shell buildstep 
python3 $JENKINS_HOME/scripts/tools/update-setup-sandbox-local.py

Add buildstep 
Docker build and Publish
sgclarkkde/kde-slave-{distro}
{Ipoftheslavehost}:2375
No pull ( we currently are not using a image repository due to private keys and the like)
No cache ( very important!!!! new dependencies will NOT get installed without this )
Build Context: Something along the lines of ( where your Dockerfile lives )
$JENKINS_HOME/scripts/docker/ubuntu-wily-slave

TO-DO:
One idea is the create a script the auto-gens a new dockerfile from yaml config files
then then triggers the respective image build on jenkins.


Misc:
To get into the docker containers login to the host
and as root 
docker run -it {containerID} /bin/bash

To get into the image with no containers running:
docker run -i -t --entrypoint /bin/bash <imageID>

Though to keep consistency it is much better to keep everything in the Dockerfiles

GOTCHAS:
Sometimes but not always, on first run for the create images, you will get authentication required. All that needs to be done is 
on the host run docker pull {base:image} aka debian:stable This is listed at the top of the Dockerfile.
TLS error. Ben needs to fill in details as he fixed it.
