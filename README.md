kde-ci-prototype
================
Highly experimental, transitional repository for testing and experimenting with new features 
for KDE's build.kde.org. Please note, these files are setup up for a local environment. 
At this time I am working on a massive overhaul of our metadata system so this repo is in a perpetual state of broken. Until further notice, use at your own risk.
